## Develop

Development uses github and expo:

1. Clone the repository:
2. From your clone directory start expo: `expo start`
3. Open your app using `Expo Go` on your Android/iOS device
4. Start hacking around

> Regular authentication doesn't work with Expo (expo doesn't support registering custom URL handlers).
